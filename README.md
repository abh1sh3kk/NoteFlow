# NoteFlow (A minimal note taking app)

Long time ago, I had an idea in my mind to build a note taking app for myself. I didn't know frontend and backend technologies back then. Now that I was feeling a bit more comfortable in these technologies I decided to make one. 

I intentionally chose some technologies I had never used before. But surprisingly I felt comfortable using them. 

Talking about it's features, it can perform CRUD operations. I used Redux for state management and MongoDB to store your notes. I tried to add authentication as well. You can easily sign up and start writing notes. If you don't want to involve in a hassle of creating an account, you can simply use *Continue as guest* feature.
